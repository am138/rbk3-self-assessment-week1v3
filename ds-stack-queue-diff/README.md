Please write your explanation below.

Queue: It follows First In First Out(FIFO) method when dealing with any new element like the line in resturant.Ex:
Queuing Systems. It has, for example, queue(add to the last of it), dequeue(remove the first element of it, size(for 
the size sure as we need to varaible tracking the first and last element key number for getting the right size).
