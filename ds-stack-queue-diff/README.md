## Data Structures
* [ ] Describe the difference between a stack and a queue and give examples of when you might use them.

## Queue vs. Stack
Please write your explanation below.

Basically, the difference between stack and queue is in the way each one organizes the data.
Queues works with FIFO (first-in-first-out) strategy, so the earlier to add the earlier to remove from the queue
While Stacks work with FILO (first-in-last-out) strategy, so the earlier to add the later to remove from the stack.

uses for queue: 
	-to implement things like.. queues! :D
	-applications where we want to reserve the order of the data
	-
uses for stack:
	-to reverse the order of data, by inserting things to queue and then pop then out one by one (in reverse order)
	-function calls stack..
	-all uses boils down to the idea of giving priority for the last added item of data.
