## Queue vs. Stack
Please write your explanation below.

Stack: for example if we have an array and we pushed an elements inside it and we made a function that delete (or pop) the last element we added to this every time we call this function that is mean we are using the Stack way.

Queue: if we have an array and we made a function that is delete (or shift) the first element in this array that is mean we are using the queue way.
