## Data Structures
* [ ] Describe the difference between a stack and a queue and give examples of when you might use them.

## Queue vs. Stack
Please write your explanation below.

stack is (last in first out)(LIFO)
that mean the last elenemt or variable or what ever come in the last will used or served or what ever will come first 
like when you put things or books on box the last book you put will be the first one you pick out.
when might I use it:
in facebook: the last commint will showed first and also when I use (ctrl+z) it will go to last thing you do and also the history in chrome or what ever will show you the least web page you visited

queue is the opposite of stack
who come first will served or used first
like when you go to resturant, the one who ordered first will served first.
when might I use it:
when I write group of equation, it will be solved squentialy the eq. that is wrote first will solved first then the next one and so on.
