## Data Structures
* [ ] Describe the difference between a stack and a queue and give examples of when you might use them.

## Queue vs. Stack
Please write your explanation below.
- A stack is last-in first-out LIFO data structure, that means the last entry is always used/executed/popped first
- Stack examples would be things like function call stack, a stack of boxes...etc
- A queue on the other hand is first-in first-out data structure, which means that the first input that goes in is the first to be used/executed/popped
- Queue examples would be supermarket's queues, bullets in machine guns...etc
