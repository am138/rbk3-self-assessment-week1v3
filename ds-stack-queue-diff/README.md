## Queue vs. Stack
Please write your explanation below.
Stack and Queue are two different kinds od Data structur :
Stack: is used to store data one by one and it  gives us the ability to get out the data from the stack also one by one.
In stack we can get the last element or bock of date stored firstly then we can get the previeos one So it called LIFO (The Last Input Is The Fisrt Out)

Queue: is used to store data one by one and it  gives us the ability to get out the data from the queue also one by one.
In Queue we can get the first  element or bock of date stored firstly then we can get the the next  one so it called FIFO (The Fisrt Input Is The Fisrt Out)
