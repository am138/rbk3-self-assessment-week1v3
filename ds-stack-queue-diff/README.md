## Data Structures
* [ ] Describe the difference between a stack and a queue and give examples of when you might use them.

## Queue vs. Stack
Please write your explanation below.
stack and queue are data structure clasess 
- stack : its a list of element or orderd element , each new element we add for example if we have a stack list dish1,dish2,dish3,---
and id we add dish4 it will be dish1,dish2,dish3,dish4
but if i want to remove element or pop i will remove the last one 
example:undo Mechnisem on microsoft word or going back in internet pages

queue: I add new elements in the same way. dish1,dish2,dish3 becomes dish1,dish2,dish3,dish4 after adding the dish4. But, now when I pop, I will take an element from the front of the list, so it becomes dish2,dish3,dish4 
example: how the interpreter solve the mathmatical exprission
