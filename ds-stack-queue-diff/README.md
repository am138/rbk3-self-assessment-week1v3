## Data Structures
* [ ] Describe the difference between a stack and a queue and give examples of when you might use them.

## Queue vs. Stack
Please write your explanation below.
queue : stores a sequence of values and the first value enters the queue is the first value removed from the queue
examples : At restaurants, first one to order is the first one being served

stack : same as queue but the only difference is that the last value that enters the stack is the first one served
examples : the goBack button at the browser , undo at sublime
