## Data Structures
* [ ] Describe the difference between a stack and a queue and give examples of when you might use them.

## Queue vs. Stack
Please write your explanation below.

Queue function: first in, first out. So we can use it when the argument I insert at first will delete it before the others. so I need to have two variables(start, end) to do the function.

Stack function: last in, first out. So we can use it when the argument I insert at last will delete it before the others. so I need to have only one variable(end) to do the function.
